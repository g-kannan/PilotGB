# PilotGB Project Overview

PilotGB is a project management platform designed for data professionals who need visibility into the full lifecycle of their data projects. Unlike generic work trackers, PilotGB models the nuanced progression of data work—including ingestion, transformation, enrichment, validation, and visualization—while keeping every deliverable anchored to an agreed Scope of Work (SOW) so teams can plan, execute, and communicate with confidence.

## Vision
- Centralize all data project initiatives in a single, collaborative workspace.
- Provide stage-aware tracking that mirrors real-world data workflows.
- Surface dependencies, risks, and quality gates tied to each progression milestone.
- Enable leadership and stakeholders to understand delivery health at a glance.

## Core Personas
- **Data Engineers**: manage pipelines, ingestion schedules, and transformation tasks.
- **Analytics Engineers**: coordinate enrichment logic, modeling steps, and semantic layers.
- **Data Analysts / Scientists**: plan experiments, dashboards, and business reporting deliverables.
- **Project Leads**: monitor delivery timelines, allocate resources, and handle cross-team coordination.

## Key Features
1. **Lifecycle Boards**
   - Kanban-style views segmented by data progression states (Ingestion → Transformation → Enrichment → Validation → Visualization → Deployment).
   - Configurable stage definitions with built-in exit criteria, quality gates, and scope guardrails tied to the SOW.

2. **Data Asset Registry**
   - Link initiatives to datasets, models, dashboards, and pipeline runs.
   - Capture contractual commitments, deliverable definitions, and acceptance criteria for each asset to ensure SOW alignment.

3. **Task Templates & Playbooks**
   - Pre-built templates for ingestion jobs, schema migrations, transformation logic updates, and visualization rollouts.
   - Reusable checklists that ensure compliance with governance, documentation, and SOW boundaries.

4. **Observability & Health Metrics**
   - Centralized dashboards that track pipeline status, data freshness, and validation results captured within PilotGB.
   - Automated alerts when progression stages stall, quality thresholds are breached, or teams attempt work outside the defined scope.

5. **Collaboration Hub**
   - Contextual discussions, decisions, and approvals attached to each stage.
   - Meeting notes, RFCs, and experiment summaries captured alongside deliverables, with explicit linkage back to SOW commitments.

## Workflow Highlights
1. **Stage-Gated Progression**
   - Every initiative advances through defined stages with tailored entry/exit requirements.
   - Stage transitions can trigger automated actions—e.g., kick off validation suites or notify visualization owners.

2. **Data-Centric Roadmaps**
   - Roadmaps align deliverables with data assets, business outcomes, strategic OKRs, and contractual commitments.
   - Roll-up views show progress by domain, team, initiative category, and SOW milestone.

3. **Risk & Dependency Management**
   - Identify blocked tasks due to upstream schema changes or missing data sources.
   - Surface critical path analytics to forecast delays, resource constraints, and potential scope deviations.

4. **Reporting & Insights**
   - Executive dashboards highlighting stage-level throughput, cycle times, quality adherence, and SOW variance.
   - Drill-down reports for auditors, governance stakeholders, and contract managers.

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in cycle time between ingestion and visualization stages.
- Increased visibility into blocked or at-risk data deliverables.
- Higher compliance with governance, documentation, and SOW requirements.
- Fewer scope deviations or change orders triggered mid-project.
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction measured via regular surveys.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Architecture**: Modular services for project orchestration, data asset registry, and analytics.
- **Scalability**: Support for large enterprises with multiple data domains and regulatory requirements.
- **Security & Compliance**: Role-based access control, audit trails, and data residency configuration.
- **Extensibility**: Configurable workflows and data models that adapt to bespoke governance rules.
- **SOW Governance**: Version-controlled scope repositories, approval workflows, and guardrails that prevent unauthorized work initiation.

## Roadmap Snapshot
- **MVP**: Lifecycle board with ingestion-to-visualization stages, task management, scope alignment checks, and basic reporting.
- **Phase 1**: Asset registry, SOW management workspace, and advanced stage analytics.
- **Phase 2**: Observability metrics, automated alerts, and governance playbooks.
- **Phase 3**: Predictive analytics for delivery forecasts, resource optimization, and scope risk modeling.

PilotGB empowers data teams to manage work with the same rigor as their pipelines, ensuring every dataset and dashboard reaches production with transparency and confidence.
