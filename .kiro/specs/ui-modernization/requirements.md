# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UI/UX Modernization and Component Refactoring feature will transform PilotGB's current functional but outdated interface into a modern, polished, and user-friendly experience. This includes implementing a cohesive design system, improving component architecture, enhancing visual hierarchy, and adding responsive design patterns while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **Design_System**: A comprehensive set of reusable UI components, patterns, and guidelines that ensure visual and functional consistency
- **Component_Library**: A collection of modular, reusable React components that follow modern design patterns
- **Visual_Hierarchy**: The arrangement and styling of UI elements to guide user attention and improve usability
- **Responsive_Layout**: A design approach that adapts the interface to different screen sizes and devices
- **Accessibility_Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements for inclusive user experience
- **Theme_System**: A centralized configuration for colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens
- **Navigation_System**: The primary and secondary navigation structure that helps users move through the application
- **Loading_States**: Visual feedback mechanisms that inform users about ongoing operations
